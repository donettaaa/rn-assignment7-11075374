# Design Choices
1. HomeScreen: Shows a product list that was retrieved from an outside API.
2. ProductDetailScreen: Provides comprehensive details on the product that has been chosen.
3. CartScreen: Shows the things that have been added to the cart along with the ability to add or remove items.
4. Drawer Navigation: This feature lets users swipe or press a button to switch between screens.

# The user interface:
Complied with the given UI mockup for uniformity.
Added icon packages to buttons and navigation items to improve their aesthetic appeal.

# Data management
1. External API Integration: To obtain product information from FakeStoreAPI.
2. Local Storage: To ensure that customers' cart items are kept in between app sessions, AsyncStorage was used to save cart data locally.
Cart data was saved and retrieved using AsyncStorage.

Created a side menu for screen navigation using the Drawer Navigator feature of React Navigation.
